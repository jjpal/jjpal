### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m a Data Professional with a combined experience in business analysis, project management & engineering. I love all the possibilities the proper usage of data brings to our day-to-day. In my free time, I immerse myself in data courses to deepen my proficiency in SQL, Python, & data viz because I believe there is always something interesting to learn ðŸ’¡.
