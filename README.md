### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an analytics professional with a background in Computer Science, Business/Data Analytics, project management, and systems/operations. I enjoy finding connections in data and communicating metrics to inform others. I appreciate the challenges of gathering, processing, modeling, and developing dashboards to help build objectives and assist in decision-making. 

I am excited about the potential opportunity to make a meaningful impact as an analyst, especially in Climate. Working on different projects collaborating with others, I focus on the bigger picture and gather insights with well-defined measures of success to help build efficient processes. Proper use of data brings many possibilities to our daily lives, and I love that.
